    <h3>THE FUTURE IS HERE! THE FUTURE IS NOW!! THE FUTURE HAS COME!!!</h3>
    <h1>WELCOME TO THE FUTURE</h1>
    <pre>
       <p>
            The future perhaps is no longer the traditional concept of some years to come.
            It is more accurate to be described as the summation of our daily activities,
            the skills we acquire, the knowledge we possess and the utilization of all these
            variables in productive manner that commands value. 
            Let nobody deceive you that your years are ahead of you. Should you relax on 
            this advice, you may wake up to realize that your years are now behind you.
            Friends, being young is a phase but growing is a continum. It is a privilege 
            that you can decide the exact life you want to live not in some years to come,
            rather now because the FUTURE IS NOW!!!
